<p>I have done my story about a person going to do Christmas shopping on a sale day.  I have included 3 other people in the JSON file with their names, and their payment types whether it be cash or credit.  I also tried to do the math to figure out when the best time to go shopping is.</p>
<p>I am still very new at this and I am hoping I did better then last weeks project!  It is getting a little easier every week.</p>
